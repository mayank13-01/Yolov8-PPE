# Yolov8-PPE
This repository contains the implementation of a YOLOv8-based deep learning model for detecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in images and videos. The model is trained to identify various types of PPE commonly used in different work environments to ensure safety protocols are followed.

# Key Features
1. YOLOv8 Architecture: Implementation of the YOLOv8 architecture using PyTorch for accurate and efficient object detection.
2. PPE Classes: Detection of multiple classes of PPE including helmets, safety vests, goggles, gloves, and masks.
3. Pre-trained Weights: Utilization of pre-trained weights for faster convergence and improved accuracy.


# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/mayank13-01/Yolov8-PPE.git
   cd YOLOv8-PPE-Detection
2. Install Dependencies
3. Run the code (python flaskapp.py)
